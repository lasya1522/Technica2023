    <h2><center>Our Inspiration</center> </h2>
    <div class="text-container">
     <p>Life is a journey. At one point or another, every individual picks up their bags and decides to explore a completely new destination which can become their home for the next couple days or even years. This could be a student going to live in college, a graduate relocating to a new area closer to their work, or a family looking to stay at a resort for their vacation. Moving or staying at a new location is a crucial step in anyone’s life, often requiring intensive planning and endless battles with yourself as you fight the mixed jitters of nervousness and excitement to start a new chapter in life. Although, just as it is important to be open to new beginnings in one’s future, it is just as important to make sure to be safe at all times. As students who have all left teh comfort of our home to embark on a new journey called college, we have faced these issues ourselves and applied our passion of giving back to our community to provide a viable solution to public safety. We work to provide users with invaluable resources that display raw details or crime patterns in specific locations to enlighten potential movers and promote safer communities.</p>

    <h2><center>Our Mission</center></h2>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p>The purpose of our website is to serve as a valuable resource for users seeking to gain a deeper understanding of crime within a specific area. This can be geared towards anyone who is looking to move or visit a new area, but values their safety and security. By collecting and analyzing data from the local police department's website, we empower our users with critical insights into crime patterns. Our platform generates various representations that allow users to make informed decisions about their safety and well-being. Through detailed crime reports, users can identify the time periods with higher crime rates, the types of criminal activities prevalent in the area, and the exact locations where these incidents occur. This knowledge is invaluable, particularly for those navigating through unfamiliar areas, as it equips them with the information needed to make safer choices and take proactive measures. Our mission is to foster a sense of security and awareness, ultimately helping our users stay safe and informed in any environment.
