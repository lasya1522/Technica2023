    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of our website is to serve as a valuable resource for users seeking to gain a deeper understanding of crime within a specific area. This can be geared towards anyone who is looking to move or visit a new area, but values their safety and security. By collecting and analyzing data from the local police department's website, we empower our users with critical insights into crime patterns. Our platform generates various representations that allow users to make informed decisions about their safety and well-being. Through detailed crime reports, users can identify the time periods with higher crime rates, the types of criminal activities prevalent in the area, and the exact locations where these incidents occur. This knowledge is invaluable, particularly for those navigating through unfamiliar areas, as it equips them with the information needed to make safer choices and take proactive measures. Our mission is to foster a sense of security and awareness, ultimately helping our users stay safe and informed in any environment.
