    <h2><center>Our Inspiration</center> </h2>
    <div class="text-container">
     <p>Life is a journey. At one point or another, every individual picks up their bags and decides to explore a completely new destination which can become their home for the next couple days or even years. This could be a student going to live in college, a graduate relocating to a new area closer to their work, or a family looking to stay at a resort for their vacation. Moving or staying at a new location is a crucial step in anyone’s life, often requiring intensive planning and endless battles with yourself as you fight the mixed jitters of nervousness and excitement to start a new chapter in life. Although, just as it is important to be open to new beginnings in one’s future, it is just as important to make sure to be safe at all times. As students who have all left teh comfort of our home to embark on a new journey called college, we have faced these issues ourselves and applied our passion of giving back to our community to provide a viable solution to public safety. We work to provide users with invaluable resources that display raw details or crime patterns in specific locations to enlighten potential movers and promote safer communities.</p>
